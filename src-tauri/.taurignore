# Ignore the source JRE directories from being watched/tracked by Tauri build system
# The build script will copy only the platform-specific JRE to build-jre/
resources/jre/**

# Don't ignore build-jre as it contains the platform-specific JRE for the current build
# resources/build-jre/** is intentionally NOT ignored
