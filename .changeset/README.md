# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick guide available to get you up and running with changesets [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/intro-to-using-changesets.md)

## How to use changesets

### Adding a changeset

When you're going to make changes to this package, you should run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

to add a changeset. This command will ask you a few questions, and then add a changeset file.

### Releasing

When you want to release, you should run:

```bash
pnpm changeset version
```

to version your packages, and then run:

```bash
pnpm changeset publish
```

to publish the packages.

### Release Process

This project uses automated releases through GitHub Actions. The release process works as follows:

1. **Create a changeset**: When you make changes, run `pnpm changeset` to document your changes
2. **Automatic versioning**: When changesets are merged to main, a PR is automatically created to bump versions
3. **Automatic release**: When the version PR is merged, the release workflow automatically:
   - Builds for all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)
   - Creates a GitHub release with detailed notes
   - Publishes artifacts
   - Creates a release branch for hotfixes

### Manual Release

If you need to force a release, you can:

1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Run the "Main Release" workflow manually
3. Choose your release type and options

### Hotfix Process

For urgent fixes:

1. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub
2. Run the "Hotfix Release" workflow
3. Specify the base version and hotfix description
4. A hotfix branch will be created automatically

## Release Types

- **patch**: Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **minor**: New features (backward compatible)
- **major**: Breaking changes

## Best Practices

1. **Always create changesets** for any changes that affect users
2. **Use clear, descriptive messages** in your changesets
3. **Mark breaking changes** with `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`
4. **Test thoroughly** before creating a changeset
5. **Review changeset PRs** carefully before merging

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Ensure all secrets are properly configured
3. Verify that the changeset format is correct
4. Check that version numbers are valid semantic versions
